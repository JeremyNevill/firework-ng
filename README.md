===========

[Firework](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/firework) is an Open Source micrologging framework.
[(firework-ng)](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/firework-ng) is Firework's AngularJs web app with Microsoft Azure back end.


## Overview

[Firework](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/firework) is designed with the following architecture, leaning heavily on the multiple services that Azure provides.

As you can see the Azure API is central to enabling multiple client apps to connect with the framework.


## Getting Started

We have just released the first version of [firework-ng](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/firework-ng), feel free to fork and get involved.


## What is Micrologging?

Micrologging is what we're calling..

'small log items that mean something, can be can be read by humans, and parsed by computers.'

We are integrating our micrologging syntax [shortee](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/shortee/blob/master/Shortee_specification.md) into firework.
The target is to allow adding of log items via json or shortee formats from any client.


## Aims

Once [firework-ng](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/firework-ng) is progressing well we will move onto providing a first native mobile app, using the same Azure Mobile Services interface to allow native access to the [Firework](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/firework) framework.

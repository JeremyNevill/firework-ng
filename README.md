firework-ng
===========

[(firework-ng)](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/firework-ng) is an AngularJs web app with Microsoft Azure back end and part of the [Firework](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/firework) Open Source micrologging framework.

[(firework-ng)](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/firework-ng) enables you to record the things you have done, like a to-done list, from any device that can handle a modern AngularJs web interface.

Items that you have added include such attributes as actor(who), action(what), amount, units, date and time.

Once stored you can browse your items by attribute and answer questions such as 'how many miles have I ran this year?'


## Getting Started

We have just released the first version of [firework-ng](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/firework-ng), feel free to fork and get involved.


## What is Micrologging?

Micrologging is what we're calling..

'small log items that mean something, can be can be read by humans, and parsed by computers.'

We are integrating our micrologging syntax [shortee](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/shortee/blob/master/Shortee_specification.md) into firework.

The target is to allow adding of log items via json or shortee formats from any client.


## Aims

Once [firework-ng](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/firework-ng) is progressing well we will move onto providing a first native mobile app, using the same Azure Mobile Services interface to allow native access to the [Firework](https://github.com/JeremyNevill/firework) framework.

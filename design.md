# Ui Design

Firework-ng is the AngularJS version web interface for the 
Firework Micrologging Framework.

All backend services (authentication, data persistance) are provided 
through APIs, making Firework-ng a 'bring your own backend' system to 
allow hosting on multiple operating systems and cloud providers.  

If access from everywhere is paramount host the backend online, if security 
is most important host yourself behind the firewall.
